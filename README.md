# easySuite
My compilation of easy rewritten scripts.

So, one night I came out with an idea. Since I spend most of the time testing softwares and punching defenses to look for patchable
vulnerabilities, I thought it was about time to create a simple shell script that compiles all the good stuff in a single element.
Right now it contains some useful tools to monitor, capture traffic and send deauth attacks. As I update the script, I will add
some more elements to do recon operations and more.
Everything I do is and always be free to use.
