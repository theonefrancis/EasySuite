# EasySuite
My compilation of easy rewritten scripts.

So, one night I came out with an idea. Since I spend most of the time testing softwares and punching defenses to look for patchable
vulnerabilities, I thought it was about time to create a simple shell script that compiles all the good stuff in a single element.
Right now it contains some useful tools to check, update and monitor the system you work on.
I have also added some third-party tools useful for learning the ropes of Penetration testing.
The final goal is to create something that will help you set up your machine quickly enough and save time in the long haul.

Features:
- Lightweight UI perfect for Linux beginners
- Update and upgrade your system
- Remove unnecessary files after installing updates
- Check system information to know everything about your machine and your connection
- A full set of user-friendly tools for people who want to dig into cybersecurity and penetration testing
